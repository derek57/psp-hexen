What is PSP-Hexen?

PSP-Hexen is a port of Raven Software's FPS game Hexen to Sony's Playstation Portable as well as Playstation Vita, using the Playstation Vita's PSP emulator (emulating a CFW is required for that). By porting Chocolate Hexen, users are able to use this homebrew to play Hexen on Sony's Playstation Portable and Playstation Vita.
